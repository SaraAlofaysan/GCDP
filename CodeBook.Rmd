Title: Wearable Computing - The Accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S Smartphone
========================================================
Course: Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
========================================================

This code book describes the variables and the data of my tidy dataset and describe all the transformations I performed to clean up the data provided in the course.

In the begining, the data are obtained and loaded from this website:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

This experiment were made on 30 subject were 70% of the results used as training set and 30% of the results used as testing set. The training set and test set are obtained and row binded together. the result data set had the total dimision of 10299 rows and 563 columns. Then, some data transformation were made. First: the activity data were labeled correctly as recorded in the dictionary below. Second: the columns are named proberly. Third: the all columns related to mean or standard devation were selected plus the activity and subject columns in order to create the new tidy data set. Lastly, the new data set were aggregated by activity and subject to calculate the mean of each column. The new tidy data set has the following dimentions ( 180 row by 75 column)
